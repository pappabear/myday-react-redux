# MyDay in React, Redux, Thunk, and Material-UI, connecting to a RESTful Node API backend

"MyDay" is a simple todo list.

## Installation

Get the simple [Node API](https://github.com/pappabear/myday-node-api) running.

## Known tech debt:

- need to DRY out /today /tomorrow views
- need to reorganize into containers and components directories
- feature: %complete on /today based on S, M, L, XL sizing
- epic: Add users, authentication, authorization
- need to add authorization and authentication
- feature: Add Recurrence to tasks
- need to add "home" content - maybe a dashboard of tasks/day, efficiency vs plan, etc
- feature: Settings
- material-ui does not support sorting
